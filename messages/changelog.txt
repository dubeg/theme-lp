v1.1.0
----------
Release Date : 10 Feb 2015

* Added Visual Studio Style setting: "lp_use_vs".

To use the vs style, you must add a file named 'Widget - LP3.sublime-settings' (OR 'Widget - LP2.sublime-settings' for ST2) in your User directory, with the following content:

    {
        "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - LP/assets/Widget_VS.stTheme"
    }

In your User Settings, add the following line:

    "lp_use_vs" : true

Note that this style overrides settings for tabs and the active sidebar row.  To use the vs folder icon, add this line to your User settings:

    "lp_use_folder_icon2": true
